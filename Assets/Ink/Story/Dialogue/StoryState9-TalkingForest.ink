W-Who's there? I'm Alduin, please don't hurt me! 
I don't even know how I got here. Can you show me the way? I'm not here to cause harm, just trying to save my family."

What's it to you, old man? I'm here for my own reasons.

You've come to rescue your family? Many have tried for centuries, but none have succeeded. 
No one who enters ever returns. Still, we'll help you, brave soul.

Nice to meet you, Alduin. Your courage to come here is admirable.

Watch your tone, disrespectful one! 
You won't pass through this forest without showing respect, or you might just become one with the trees. Threats won't serve you well here.

My apologies, please, please don't hurt me! 
I don't want to act like thisâ€”I'm just trying to save my parents. This place scares me, please forgive me.

Do as you wish, but beware: any trouble you cause here will come back to haunt you. Be on your way!

You're welcome, kind soul. Let me show you the way out. Follow the forest trail, and when you reach the end, avoid the left path. Continue straight ahead to find your guide. As for who it is... I can't reveal too much. But trust me, they're expecting you. I have faith in you.
